This should be about a page or so down.</li>\n<li>Delete from the beginning character of the file to the character just before ‘CWS’ or ‘FWS’. In XVI32 you would do a ‘Block Mark’ at the beginning and another at the spot before ‘CWS’ or ‘FWS’ then do a ‘Block Delete’.</li>\n<li>Save the file and rename the extension to ‘SWF’ and voila!</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to extract any version of SWF from Adobe Director (.DIR) files for free"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/how-to-extract-any-version-of-swf-from-adobe-director-dir-files-for-free","nextPost":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-importance-of-briefs-communication-and-templates"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The importance of briefs, communication and templates"}},"prevPost":{"fields":{"slug":"/in-the-future-would-html5-based-games-be-the-norm"},"frontmatter":{"title":"In the future, would HTML5-based games be the norm?"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
