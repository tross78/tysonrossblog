Do they really work for the average 15 year old in the classroom of a public school?</p>\n<p>Augmented Reality, for example, seems much more at home on mobile phones rather than behind a school computer in a classroom full of 30 kids.  Of course, not every kid is going to get an iPhone though! However, if it is done for a specific purpose, such as a group experiment  it may work!</p>\n<p>Real-time 3D visualization of concepts and objects is revolutionary in eLearning, but would be limited to basic objects due to expense when having to cover such a wide area of subject areas. I think it would work if it is used sparingly to illustrate difficult concepts.</p>\n<p>Social networking has the greatest promise. Collaboration and competition would be the main focus. Gaming and rewards would really engage an otherwise bored student. These are used in 3rd-party remedial and catchup businesses, so why not in the classroom?</p>\n<p>Much more experimentation is needed in this area to test whether these technologies help or hinder the learning process.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"are new technologies in education suitable for the classroom?"}}},"pageContext":{"allPosts":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/how-to-extract-any-version-of-swf","title":"How to extract any version of SWF from Adobe Director (.DIR) files for free"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/html5-games-future","title":"In the future, would HTML5-based games be the norm?"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/importance-of-briefs","title":"The importance of briefs, communication and templates"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/new-education-tech","title":"are new technologies in education suitable for the classroom?"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/old-school-game-techniques","title":"Links on old-school game techniques"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/brisbane-html5-subreddit","title":"Created a Brisbane HTML5 community subreddit!"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/helpful-html5","title":"List of helpful HTML5 guides, frameworks and tools"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/learning-angular","title":"Learning AngularJS with a little stock widget"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/teensy-arduino","title":"Working on a Teensy/Arduino"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/zelda-assignment","title":"Challenging zelda-like game assignment for teensy microcontroller"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/aussie-payment-apis","title":"Great aussie payment APIs supporting bPay for small biz"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/arduino-porting","title":"Porting from Arduino to NES/C64"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/disney-html5-games","title":"Working on...
