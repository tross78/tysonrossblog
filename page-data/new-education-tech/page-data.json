Do they really work for the average 15 year old in the classroom of a public school?</p>\n<p>Augmented Reality, for example, seems much more at home on mobile phones rather than behind a school computer in a classroom full of 30 kids.  Of course, not every kid is going to get an iPhone though! However, if it is done for a specific purpose, such as a group experiment  it may work!</p>\n<p>Real-time 3D visualization of concepts and objects is revolutionary in eLearning, but would be limited to basic objects due to expense when having to cover such a wide area of subject areas. I think it would work if it is used sparingly to illustrate difficult concepts.</p>\n<p>Social networking has the greatest promise. Collaboration and competition would be the main focus. Gaming and rewards would really engage an otherwise bored student. These are used in 3rd-party remedial and catchup businesses, so why not in the classroom?</p>\n<p>Much more experimentation is needed in this area to test whether these technologies help or hinder the learning process.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"are new technologies in education suitable for the classroom?"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
