Decided to get right into learning AngularJS by building a stock widget!

There aren’t many good places to get stock data for free without restrictions. I had to look up Yahoo’s YQL for stock symbols, it doesn’t give everything out in one dump unfortunately!

Loving the Directives. They seem a little equivalent to CSS selectors in some ways.
