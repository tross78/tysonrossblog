So this semester at my IT degree i'm programming micro-controllers as a part of my CS minor.

I grew up with the Commodore 64 computer and it had a lot of really great demos that pushed the system to its limits.

One cool effect was the sine scroller that curled and bumped along text on alternating sine lines. I guess it was the 'blog post' of its time!
