In a recent educational web development project, I harnessed the power of **Drupal** as a CMS and **Gatsby** for front-end rendering. The goal was to create a user-friendly, responsive, and engaging platform for students and educators.

Drupal's flexibility allowed for the creation of custom content types, providing a seamless content management experience. Gatsby's ability to fetch data from various sources, including Drupal, enabled the development of a high-performance static site.

Integrating these technologies resulted in a lightning-fast, SEO-friendly educational platform. The new site boasted a user-centered design, empowering students and teachers to interact and learn effectively. By combining Drupal and Gatsby, I was able to deliver an innovative and efficient solution tailored to the needs of the education sector.
