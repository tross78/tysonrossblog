Been looking into old-school game techniques, especially the Gameboy. I think these are really applicable to mobile HTML5 games as the limitations are very similar.

They can easily be ported to Javascript and Canvas. Although can be time consuming. You could use Emscripten, a C++ to Javascript converter to help.
